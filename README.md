# The-Lannisters-Memory-Game-2.0
Better version of my project The Lannisters Memory Game. This version is made in accordance with ECMAScript 6 standards. There is also somethin new in gameplay - cards are picked randomly and the game can be reloaded with one single click, without refreshing the browser. I also added the information about game time shown when the game is ended (in previous version there was only info about turns number). I also reduced jQuery code to minimum because my goal was to practice Vanilla JS in this project ;-) The graphic side was made in CSS3 just like it was before. Enjoy the game!
